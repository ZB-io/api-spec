**Functional Test Cases**

1. **Credit Card Due Reminder**
  - Input: Credit card due date is 01/12/2022
  - Expected output: Reminder notification is sent to the cardholder on 30/11/2022
  - Edge case: If due date falls on a weekend or holiday, expect the reminder to be sent on the previous working day.

2. **Overdue Balance Alert**
  - Input: Payment due date passed (Example: Due date = 01/12/2022, Current date = 02/12/2022)
  - Expected output: Overdue balance alert is sent to the cardholder on 02/12/2022
  - Edge case: Alerts should be triggered on the first day of overdue, and not before the due date.

3. **Collection Notification**
  - Input: Account has become significantly delinquent (Example: Overdue period crosses 60 days)
  - Expected output: Collection notification outlining the amount due and potential additional charges is sent to the cardholder.
  - Edge case: If the account is just a few days past the due date, a collection notice should not be sent.

4. **Payment Plan Proposal**
  - Input: Cardholder indicates inability to pay the full overdue balance.
  - Expected output: A payment plan proposal, with a structured repayment schedule and potentially reduced rates or fees, is provided to the cardholder.
  - Edge case: If an account is only slightly delinquent, do not trigger a payment plan proposal.

5. **Collection Agency Involvement**
  - Input: Cardholder has not responded to previous notifications and reminders (Example: No response after 3 consecutive notifications)
  - Expected output: A collection agency is involved to recover the overdue balance.
  - Edge case: Involve a collection agency only after multiple notifications and an ample time period have been provided for the cardholder to respond.

6. **Legal Action Initiation**
  - Input: Cardholder has defaulted on payment and has not responded to the previous interventions (Example: Overdue period crosses 180 days)
  - Expected output: The card issuer initiates legal action against the cardholder.
  - Edge case: Legal action should be the last resort and should only be initiated after all other collection efforts have failed to recover the overdue balance.


**Non-Functional Test Cases**

1. **Performance Tests**
  - Test the system under high loads, such as during peak times, to ensure it can handle sending notifications to a large number of cardholders without degradation in performance.

2. **Usability Tests**
  - Verify that notifications, alerts, and messages sent to cardholders are clear, concise, and easy to understand on various platforms.

3. **Security Tests**
  - Ensure the system securely stores and handles sensitive cardholder data during all stages of the card payment collection process.

4. **Reliability Tests**
  - Test whether the system can reliably send notifications and alerts as and when they are needed, without failure.

5. **Compatibility Tests**
  - Check that notifications, alerts, and messages display correctly on different device types and screen sizes.

6. **Resilience Tests**
  - Test how well the system can recover from problems or failures, such as a network outage, and ensure it maintains all critical data. 

7. **Compliance Tests**
  - Ensure all processes comply with relevant legal and regulatory standards.
