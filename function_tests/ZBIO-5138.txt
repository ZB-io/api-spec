**Functional Test Cases**

1. **Credit Card Due Reminder**
   - Input: Credit Card Due Date is set to 10/04/2023
   - Expected output: Reminder notification is sent on 09/04/2023
   - Edge case: Reminder should be sent even if the due date falls on a weekend or holiday.

2. **Overdue Balance Alert**
   - Input: The current date is 11/04/2023, and the due date was 10/04/2023
   - Expected output: Overdue balance alert is sent on 11/04/2023
   - Edge case: Alert should be sent even if the system encounters a high volume of alerts to be sent out.

3. **Collection Notification**
   - Input: Account has been delinquent for a significant period (e.g., 60 days past due)
   - Expected output: Collection notification is sent detailing the amount owed and additional charges
   - Edge case: Notification should not be sent if the account's delinquency status has been mistakenly classified due to a system error.

4. **Payment Plan Proposal**
   - Input: Cardholder communicates inability to pay the full overdue balance
   - Expected output: A payment plan proposal is presented to the cardholder
   - Edge case: Payment plan should not be offered to cardholders who have a history of rejecting or failing to comply with previous payment plans.

5. **Collection Agency Involvement**
   - Input: Cardholder has not responded to collection notifications within the set timeframe (e.g., 90 days past due)
   - Expected output: A collection agency is involved in the process
   - Edge case: Ensure the collection agency is only involved after all internal collection efforts have been exhausted.

6. **Legal Action Initiation**
   - Input: Cardholder defaults on payment for an extended period (e.g., 180 days past due)
   - Expected output: Legal action is initiated against the cardholder
   - Edge case: Legal action should only be initiated after verifying that all other collection efforts have been unsuccessful and all regulatory requirements for such action have been met.

**Non-Functional Test Cases**

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test the system's ability to send a large number of notifications within a specified timeframe without performance degradation.

2. **Usability Testing**
   - Evaluate the clarity and understandability of notification messages sent to cardholders.

3. **Security Testing**
   - Ensure that the system securely handles cardholder data during the notification and collection process.

4. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Verify that notifications are correctly formatted and delivered across various email clients and devices.

5. **Recovery Testing**
   - Simulate system failures to test the system's ability to recover and continue sending notifications without data loss.

6. **Reliability Testing**
   - Assess the system's consistency in sending notifications as scheduled over an extended period.
