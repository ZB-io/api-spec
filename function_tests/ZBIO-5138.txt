**Functional Test Cases**

1. **Credit Card Due Reminder**
   - Input: Credit Card Due Date is set to 10/05/2023
   - Expected output: Reminder notification is sent on 09/05/2023
   - Edge case: Reminder should be sent one day prior even if the due date is on a weekend or holiday

2. **Overdue Balance Alert**
   - Input: The current date is 11/05/2023 and the due date was 10/05/2023
   - Expected output: Overdue balance alert is sent on 11/05/2023
   - Edge case: Alert should be sent immediately after the due date passes, without any delay

3. **Collection Notification**
   - Input: Account is 30 days past due
   - Expected output: Collection notification is sent, detailing the amount owed and any additional charges
   - Edge case: Ensure notifications are not sent to accounts with disputes on record until the dispute is resolved

4. **Payment Plan Proposal**
   - Input: Cardholder contacts issuer indicating an inability to pay the full overdue balance
   - Expected output: A payment plan proposal is sent with a structured repayment schedule and potential reduced interest rates or fees
   - Edge case: The system should not propose a payment plan if the cardholder has not communicated financial hardship

5. **Collection Agency Involvement**
   - Input: The account is 60 days past due and the cardholder has not responded to previous notifications
   - Expected output: A collection agency is engaged to recover the overdue balance
   - Edge case: Verify that the collection agency is only involved after all internal collection efforts have been exhausted

6. **Legal Action Initiation**
   - Input: The account is 90 days past due, and no payment plan has been agreed upon
   - Expected output: Legal action is initiated against the cardholder
   - Edge case: Legal action protocols are followed meticulously to ensure compliance with laws and regulations

**Non-Functional Test Cases**

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test Case: Simulate peak load where multiple reminders and alerts are sent out simultaneously to evaluate system performance
   - Expected Output: The system should handle the load without significant performance degradation

2. **Usability Testing**
   - Test Case: Evaluate the clarity and understandability of notification messages for various user demographics
   - Expected Output: Messages should be comprehensible and actionable by the majority of users

3. **Security Testing**
   - Test Case: Conduct vulnerability assessments to ensure that cardholder data is secure during notification dispatch
   - Expected Output: No security vulnerabilities should be present that could compromise cardholder data

4. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Test Case: Verify that notifications are correctly displayed and functional across various devices and operating systems
   - Expected Output: Notifications should be consistently formatted and accessible on all supported devices

5. **Recovery Testing**
   - Test Case: Introduce system failures to assess recovery procedures and data integrity
   - Expected Output: The system should recover from failures without data loss and continue to operate effectively

6. **Reliability Testing**
   - Test Case: Monitor the system over an extended period to ensure there are no unexpected failures or disruptions
   - Expected Output: The system should demonstrate consistent and reliable performance over time
